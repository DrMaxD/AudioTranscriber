# AudioTranscriber

**Description**

Audio Transcriber that will allow people to take a MP3 file and have the audio contents transcribed to midi/sheet music.

**Summary**

I have been playing the saxophone since the 4th grade and have done multiple ensembles. One thing I've done in the past primarily for different jazz ensembles is transcribing other solos. In the past I have done this by ear and listening to a recording multiple times. While it works, it takes up a lot of time. My goal for this project is to import a .MP3 audio file and have the program analyze this audio file and creating a midi file and sheet music of the recording.
